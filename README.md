# Kubernetes on Azure The Hard Way

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. If that's you then check out [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), or the [Getting Started Guides](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and may receive limited support from the community, but don't let that stop you from learning!

Inspired from [Kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/README.md). Actually its the same tutorial but for Azure.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a production Kubernetes cluster and wants to understand how everything fits together.

## Cluster Details

Kubernetes The Hard Way guides you through bootstrapping a highly available Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end encryption between components and RBAC authentication.
